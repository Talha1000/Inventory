Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory_management_system.git. After navigating to the project directory, run composer install to install the necessary dependencies. Copy the .env.example file to create a new .env file, and generate the application key with php artisan key:generate.

Database Setup
Create a MySQL database and update the .env file with your database credentials. Run php artisan migrate to set up the required tables. Optionally, you can seed the database with sample data using php artisan db:seed.

Usage
Start the development server with php artisan serve and access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8000. The application provides user-friendly interfaces for managing products, including functionalities for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting product details.

Authentication

Folder Structure
The project's folder structure is organized to maintain a clean separation of concerns. The app directory contains the core application logic, while the resources directory holds assets such as Blade views and frontend resources.
